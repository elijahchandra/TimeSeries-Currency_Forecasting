This exercise accomplishes the following tasks:

Linear Regression Forecasting
1. Data preparation (creating returns and lagged returns, and splitting the data into training and testing data)
2. Fitting a linear regression model.
3. Making predictions using the testing data.
4. Out-of-sample performance.
5. In-sample performance.

Time-Series Forecasting
1. Plotting the Settle price to check for long or short-term patterns
2. Decomposition using a Hodrick-Prescott filter (decompose the settle price into trend and noise).
3. Forecasting returns using an ARMA model.
4. Forecasting the exchange rate price using an ARIMA model.
5. Forecasting volatility with GARCH.
